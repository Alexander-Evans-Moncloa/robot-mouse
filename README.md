Abstract— The purpose of this task is to create an automated electric vehicle ‘mouse’ that follows a 20m electromagnetic track in the lowest time possible. This paper outlines how the mouse circuitry was created, implemented and modified along with a discussion of the Arduino code used to incorporate PID control and other time optimisations through software. Finally, mechanical designs for improved velocity are outlined and overall vehicle speed results are discussed.
